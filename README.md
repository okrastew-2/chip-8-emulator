# CHIP-8 Emulator/Interpreter

Hello! This is my attempt at a CHIP-8 interpreter and my first foray into hardware emulation. My implementation chiefly follows the COSMAC VIP architecture, so some opcodes may exhibit outdated behavior. Some future plans include making opcode behavior configurable and creating a user GUI for loading ROMs and configuring settings.
